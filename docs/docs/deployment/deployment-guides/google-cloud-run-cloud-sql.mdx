# Deploying Hasura GraphQL Engine on Cloud Run

To deploy Hasura GraphQL Engine on Google Cloud Run with a Cloud SQL (Postgres) instance and ensure secure communication
via private IP, follow this detailed guide.

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en) account and `gcloud` [installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Additionally, you should be working within a Google Cloud Project, whether it's one you've newly created or an existing project you have access to.
:::


## Step 1: Setup Your Environment

1. **Authenticate with Google Cloud:**

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

2. **Set your project ID:**

Replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

```bash
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
```

## Step 2: Enable Required Google Cloud Services

Enable Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud SQL Admin, and the Service Networking APIs:


```bash
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com sqladmin.googleapis.com servicenetworking.googleapis.com
```

:::caution Requires IAM permissions

To execute the above command, your Google Cloud account needs to have the Service Usage Admin role (roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin) or an equivalent custom role with permissions to enable services. This role allows you to view, enable, and disable services in your GCP project.

If you encounter permissions errors, contact your GCP administrator to ensure your account has the appropriate roles assigned, or to request the services be enabled on the project you are working with.

:::

## Step 3: Create a Cloud SQL (Postgres) Instance

1. **Create the database instance:**

```bash
gcloud sql instances create hasura-postgres --database-version=POSTGRES_15 --cpu=2 --memory=7680MiB --region=us-central1
```

2. **Set the password** for the default postgres user:

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with your desired password.

```bash
gcloud sql users set-password postgres --instance=hasura-postgres --password=<PASSWORD>
```

3. **Create a database**

Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` with your database name:

```bash
gcloud sql databases create <DATABASE_NAME> --instance=hasura-postgres
```

## Step 4: Configure Service Networking for Private Connectivity

1. **Allocate an IP range** for Google services in your VPC:

```bash
gcloud compute addresses create google-managed-services-default \
    --global \
    --purpose=VPC_PEERING \
    --prefix-length=24 \
    --network=default
```

2. **Connect your VPC to the Service Networking API:**

Replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

```bash
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
    --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
    --ranges=google-managed-services-default \
    --network=default \
    --project=<PROJECT_ID>
```

3. **Enable a private IP** for your CloudSQL instance:

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch hasura-postgres --network=default
```

## Step 5: Deploy Hasura GraphQL Engine to Cloud Run

1. **Find your Cloud SQL instance's connection name:**

```bash
gcloud sql instances describe hasura-postgres
```

:::info Note

Take note of the `connectionName` field in the output of the above `describe` command. You will use the `connectionName` in the following command to deploy GraphQL Engine to Cloud Run.

:::

2. **Deploy Hasura to Cloud Run:**

Replace `<CONNECTION_NAME>`, `<PASSWORD>`, and `<DATABASE_NAME>` with your actual connectionName, database password, and
database name.

For additional information on configuring the Hasura GraphQL engine, please see the [Server configuration reference](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference/).

```bash
gcloud run deploy hasura-graphql-engine \
    --image=hasura/graphql-engine:latest \
    --add-cloudsql-instances=<CONNECTION_NAME> \
    --update-env-vars='HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:<PASSWORD>@/<DATABASE_NAME>?host=/cloudsql/<CONNECTION_NAME>,HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true' \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --cpu=1 \
    --min-instances=1 \
    --memory=2048Mi \
    --port=8080 \
    --allow-unauthenticated
```


## Step 6: Adding a VPC-Connector (Optional)

To further enhance the connectivity and security of your Hasura GraphQL Engine deployment on Google Cloud Run,
especially when connecting to other services within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you might consider adding a
Serverless VPC Access connector. This optional step is particularly useful when your architecture requires direct access
from your serverless Cloud Run service to resources within your VPC, such as VMs, other databases, or private services
that are not exposed to the public internet. For more information, please see [Google's official documentation for Serverless VPC Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/serverless-vpc-access).

1. **Enable the Serverless VPC Access API**

First ensure that the Serverless VPC Access API is enabled:

```bash
gcloud services enable vpcaccess.googleapis.com
```

2. **Create a Serverless VPC Access Connector**

Choose an IP range that does not overlap with existing ranges in your VPC. This range will be used by the connector to
route traffic from your serverless application to your VPC. **It's important to ensure that the IP range does not overlap with other subnets to avoid routing conflicts.**

```bash
gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create hasura-connector \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --network=default \
    --range=10.8.0.0/28
```

3. **Update the Cloud Run Deployment to use the VPC Connector**

When deploying or updating your Hasura GraphQL Engine service, specify the VPC connector with the `--vpc-connector`
flag:

```bash
gcloud run deploy hasura-graphql-engine \
    --image=hasura/graphql-engine:latest \
    --add-cloudsql-instances=<CONNECTION_NAME> \
    --update-env-vars='HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:<PASSWORD>@/<DATABASE_NAME>?host=/cloudsql/<CONNECTION_NAME>,HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true' \
    --vpc-connector=hasura-connector \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --cpu=1 \
    --min-instances=1 \
    --memory=2048Mi \
    --port=8080 \
    --allow-unauthenticated
```

### When and Why to Use a VPC Connector

* **Enhanced Security:** Utilize a VPC Connector when you need to ensure that traffic between your Cloud Run service and
  internal Google Cloud resources does not traverse the public internet, enhancing security.
* **Access to Internal Resources:** Use it when your serverless application needs access to resources within your VPC,
  such
  as internal APIs, databases, or services that are not publicly accessible.
* **Compliance Requirements:** If your application is subject to compliance requirements that mandate data and network
  traffic must remain within a private network, a VPC connector facilitates this by providing private access to your
  cloud resources.
* **Network Peering:** It's beneficial when accessing services in a peered VPC, allowing your Cloud Run services to
  communicate with resources across VPC networks.

Adding a VPC Connector to your Cloud Run deployment ensures that your Hasura GraphQL Engine can securely and privately
access the necessary Google Cloud resources within your VPC, providing a robust and secure environment for your
applications.

## Tearing Down

To avoid incurring charges, delete the resources once you're done:

```bash
gcloud sql instances delete hasura-postgres
gcloud run services delete hasura-graphql-engine
gcloud compute addresses delete google-managed-services-default --global
```

If you performed the optional Step 6, you should also delete the VPC-connector resource:

```bash
gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors delete hasura-connector --region=us-central1
```
